                    Hope you all had a great weekend and are ready for another
                    week and another VandyApps meeting! We have something
                    different going on this week, as Microsoft will be joining
                    us on Tuesday! First and foremost they're going to be giving
                    a tech talk on working at Microsoft, so if you're interested
                    in working there sometime in the future it would be in your
                    best interest to attend.

                    Employee will be giving a workshop on his work on the
                    Microsoft HoloLens experience team! After that we'll have
                    some meet and greet time if you'd like to chat with either
                    of the Microsoft reps, ask them questions, get resume
                    advice, etc.
