                    Today is our last meeting of the semester, so we have a few
                    special things for this week.

                    There will be food, so come by and have some pizza with us!
                    We will also be having elections during today's meeting.
                    Come and meet the candidates, and most importantly, let your
                    voice be heard! Finally, we will be having a tech talk on
                    how to get the most out of your summer. Whether you have an
                    internship or not, we'll give you a few tips to make the
                    most out of whatever you end up doing (in terms of CS).

                    a tech talk on working at Microsoft, so if you're interested
